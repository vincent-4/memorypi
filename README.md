# Remember Me

When's the last time you had people sign your yearbook or your shirt? Do you ever wish it lasted longer, or reached more people? Wouldn't it be nice to have a keepsake of everyone you meet while travelling?

We made Remember Me because we wanted to treasure each and every encounter, and made a device to hold messages and doodles the people you meet want to send to you! Remember Me is a web app hosted locally over a RPi + RPico that allows people to connect via any WiFi enabled device to share mail and photos, which can be scheduled to be shown in the future and all stored locally on the RPi. The RPi connects to the RPico to allow messages to be displayed on an e-ink monitor, with buttons and a main menu to go through all stored messages.
