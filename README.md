# Mem Pi

MPi is a locally hosted web application running on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) that enables users to share and store messages and photos. Accessible via any WiFi-enabled device, it allows users to submit content securely, with options to schedule future displays. All data is stored locally on the RPi, ensuring privacy.

The system connects the RPi to a Raspberry Pi Pico (RPico), which drives an e-ink monitor to display messages. Navigation through stored content is managed via physical buttons, providing a simple, offline way to browse and revisit messages. This setup preserves meaningful interactions in a secure and tangible format.
